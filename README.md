# groupproject3
This group project will be parsing and analyzing log files from an Apache web server.

I wrote this code in Spyder (Python 3.8).

FUNCTION:
This code will output both the total number of requests for the log as well as the total number of requests for 1995 only.

NOTE:
You will notice that there is a path in the code. In order for the script to access the local_copy.log you will need to map the FILE_NAME to wherever the local_copy.log is stored on your local machine.
